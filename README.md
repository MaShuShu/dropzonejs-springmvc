====================

A complete example on DropzoneJS integration with Spring MVC

This project demostrate how to use DropzoneJS library to upload files to the server. And some customizing features have also been covered in this example. The uploading of files to the server has been simulated by creating a simple Spring MVC + Maven + Hibernate project. The uploaded files are saved in local disks and the files information are stored in database.
There are two pages. One page is for uploading the files to the server and another one is for listing out all the uploaded files. There is a download button for each listed file so that you can even download the files individually.
